This is a clone of the Amazon homepage. The goal of this project is to replicate the structure, layout, and some basic functionalities of Amazon using HTML and CSS. The project is designed to help improve my skills in front-end web development and web design.

This project is a front-end clone of Amazon's homepage. The design was made to resemble the original Amazon layout using basic web technologies, with no backend functionality (like user login or checkout).
